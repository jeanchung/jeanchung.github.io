    Express, PostgreSQL, React Native, and Redux. Users leave "eggs," or messages, for their
    friends at specific locations. A message can only be read when the recipient has
    entered the egg's geofence. Hatch uses the Facebook SDK to connect users with their Facebook
    friends, encodes images in base64 for secure server-side storage, and sets up geofences of
    a 1/2 block radius from a user's selected location.`,
