        <p>I love solving meaningful problems.</p>
        <p>After graduating from college, I spent four years in Washington, D.C. working on a
          problem I care about very much: our nation&#39;s
          broken <a href="http://www.sentencingproject.org/">criminal justice system</a>.</p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I began teaching myself to code, attending free Python classes
          offered by <a href="http://hearmecode.com/">Hear Me Code</a>, working through Project Euler
          problems, and completing an online MIT computer science course.
        </p>
        <p>It wasn&#39;t long before I knew: I wanted to solve problems with code.</p>
        <p>
          In 2016, I attended <a href="http://fullstackacademy.com">Fullstack Academy&#39;s</a> software
            engineering immersive, and today, I&#39;m a full stack software developer.
