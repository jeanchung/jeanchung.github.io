        <p><strong>I love solving problems.</strong></p>
        <p>After graduating from college, I spent four years in Washington, D.C. working on a
          problem I care about very much: our nation&#39;s
          broken <a href="http://www.sentencingproject.org/">criminal justice system</a>.</p>
        <p>
          During that time, I began do something I&#39;d always been curious about:
          learning to code. I started teaching myself in my spare time, attending free classes offered
          by <a href="https://hearmecode.com/">Hear Me Code</a>, working through Project Euler
          problems, and completing MIT&#39;s introductory computer science course.
        </p>
        <p>It wasn&#39;t long before I knew: I wanted to solve problems with code.</p>
        <p>
          In 2016, I attended <a href="fullstackacademy.com">Fullstack Academy&#39;s</a> software
            engineering immersive, and today, I&#39;m a full stack software developer.
